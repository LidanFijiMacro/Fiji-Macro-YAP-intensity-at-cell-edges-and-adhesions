# Fiji-Macro-YAP-intensity-at-cell-edges-and-adhesions
This repository contains three Macro files for analyzing confocal images.

## 1. Macro_pYAP_intensity_at_cell_edges.ijm
This Macro draws a line across a cell, which rotates clockwise every 30 degrees and analyzes the intensity of pYAP along the lines.

### 2. Macro_pYAP_intensity_at_adhesions.ijm
This Macro detects adhesions at cell edges and analyzes pYAP intensity at adhesions and adhesion sizes.

#### 3. Macro_Colocalizaiton of pYAP and vinculin.ijm
This Macro uses a Fiji plug-in (JaCop) to analyze co-localization coefficients between pYAP and adhesion marker (vinculin).
